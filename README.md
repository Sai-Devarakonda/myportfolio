## Usage 

This section goes over the tweaks that need to be made, and where can they be made. It also talks about the free emailing service that is been used.

### Information 

All the information on the template is present in `info.js` that can be found in the root directory. This consists of various parameters that handle the information on the website. All pictures are in `/src/assets`.

### Email.js 

The **contact** section of the template makes use of this API called [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/). It is a good service that provides 200 email free every month. You will need to configure your own emailjs account for the service to work.

#### Configuration
1. Head over to [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create your account.
2. Once logged in, select a service. In my case I selected **gmail**.
3. Head over to **Email Templates** on the side and click on **Email Template Example**. Here, there are few changes to be made if you don't want to change the template's javascript code.
    - Change the subject attribute to: `New message from {{from_name}}!`
    - Change the body to, 
    ```js
    Hello {{to_name}},

    You got a new message from {{from_name}}:

    {{{message_html}}}

    My contact is: {{user_email}}.
    ```
    You can configure this however you want, but the attributes in the `{{ }}` need to be those.
4. Create a file called `config.js` in the root of the project. You'll notice that the `.gitignore` has the name of this file. This is where all the data that links your web app to emailjs will be stores.
5. Create a object that looks like this,
   ```js
   let config = {
        emailjs: {
            serviceID: '<serviceID>',
            templateID: '<templateID>',
            userID: '<userID>'
        }
    }

    export default config;
   ```
6. You need to get the above mentioned IDs from your emailjs account,
   - **serviceID**: From `Email Services`
   - **templateID**: From `Email Templates`
   - **userID**: From `Account` > `API Keys`

> Make sure your `config.js` is in `.gitignore` as you do not want to expose your keys to the public.
